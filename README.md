# MINESWEEPER
- Recreation of the classic Minesweeper Game made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Minesweeper is a game where you have to reveal the whole board while not clicking on any mines. Every time you click on a square, and it's not a mine, the number shows how many mines are adjacent to that square, and reveals other adjacent square numbers if there are 0 mines around those squares
- Adjacent means "left, right, top, bottom, and diagonals"
- If you believe there is a mine on a square, right-click on that square to put a flag on it.
- Right click to put a flag
- Left click to reveal the numbers or the mine
-  Added the # of mines changer, where you can change the number of mines the next time you play, and press submit
